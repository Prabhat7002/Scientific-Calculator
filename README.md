# Scientific-Calculator
This was my college's minor project. <br>
<em>Technology used: </em> XML, Java and some of my creativity. <br>
Creativity for designing the UI. <br>
XML for creating the UI for the app. <br>
Java for writing the logic of the calculations. <br>

There are two modes of calculator: <br>
1. Potrait mode( Simple Calculator) <br>
2. Landscape mode( Scientific Calculator) <br>

Simple Caculator provides simple operation like addition, subtraction and some other basic calculations. <br>
Whereas Scientific Calculator provides more complex operations like logarithms, trigonometry and others. <br>

It was a great learning experience building this.
